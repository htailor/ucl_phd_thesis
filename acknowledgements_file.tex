\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost I offer my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof Ian Ford, who has supported and guided me throughout my thesis with his patience and knowledge. I attribute the level of my degree to his encouragement and continuous effort. One simply could not have wished for a better, or friendlier supervisor. Thanks also to my second supervisor Dr Laurent Bozec for his useful inputs during the course of my research.

To my friends; I would like to thank Dr Alex Rutherford, Dr Alastair Dunn, Dr Alex Grimwood, Dr Matthew Wolf, Matthew Sheirs, and Savvas Papasavva.
Your company and friendship have made these years some of the most memorable, thank you for the good times!

To the people I love; a special thanks goes to Prakash and Hina Tailor, for there are fewer greater comforts in moments of adversity than having loving family at my side. Finally, I would like to thank my loving parents, Arvind and Nalini Tailor, for their unconditional support, both financially and emotionally throughout my degree. I dedicate this thesis to you.
