abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to compute the difference in the unfolding free energy between wild-type barnase and the mutant in which Ile-96 is replaced by alanine. The simulations yield results (-3.42 and -5.21 kcal/mol) that compare favorably with experimental values (-3.3 and -4.0 kcal/mol). The major contributions to the free energy difference arise from bonding terms involving degrees of freedom of the mutated side chain and from nonbonded interactions of that side chain with its environment in the folded protein. By comparison with simulations of an extended peptide in the absence of solvent, used as a reference state, hydration effects are shown to play a minor role in the overall free energy balance for the Ile----Ala transformation. The implications of these results for our understanding of the hydrophobic effect and its contribution to protein stability are discussed.},

In this model, the system diffuses within a sphere in the presence of an attractive spherically symmetric potential. The native state is represented by a small sphere in the center, and the remaining space is identified with unfolded states. The folding temperature, the time-dependence of the populations, and the relaxation rate are calculated, and the folding dynamics is analyzed for both golf-course and funnel-like energy landscapes. This simple model allows us to illustrate a surprising number of concepts including entropic barriers, transition states, funnels, and the origin of single exponential relaxation kinetics.},

abstract = {Collagen is a protein material with superior mechanical properties. It consists of collagen fibrils composed of a staggered array of ultra-long tropocollagen (TC) molecules. Theoretical and molecular modeling suggests that this natural design of collagen fibrils maximizes the strength and provides large energy dissipation during deformation, thus creating a tough and robust material. We find that the mechanics of collagen fibrils can be understood quantitatively in terms of two critical molecular length scales chi(S) and chi(R) that characterize when (i) deformation changes from homogeneous intermolecular shear to propagation of slip pulses and when (ii) covalent bonds within TC molecules begin to fracture, leading to brittle-like failure. The ratio chi(S)/chi(R) indicates which mechanism dominates deformation. Our modeling rigorously links the chemical properties of individual TC molecules to the macroscopic mechanical response of fibrils. The results help to explain why collagen fibers found in nature consist of TC molecules with lengths in the proximity of 300 nm and advance the understanding how collagen diseases that change intermolecular adhesion properties influence mechanical properties.},

abstract = {We report molecular modeling of stretching single molecules of tropocollagen, the building block of collagen fibrils and fibers that provide mechanical support in connective tissues. For small deformation, we observe a dominance of entropic elasticity. At larger deformation, we find a transition to energetic elasticity, which is characterized by first stretching and breaking of hydrogen bonds, followed by deformation of covalent bonds in the protein backbone, eventually leading to molecular fracture. Our force-displacement curves at small forces show excellent quantitative agreement with optical tweezer experiments. Our model predicts a persistence length xi(p) approximately 16 nm, confirming experimental results suggesting that tropocollagen molecules are very flexible elastic entities. We demonstrate that assembly of single tropocollagen molecules into fibrils significantly decreases their bending flexibility, leading to decreased contributions of entropic effects during deformation. The molecular simulation results are used to develop a simple continuum model capable of describing an entire deformation range of tropocollagen molecules. Our molecular model is capable of describing different regimes of elastic and permanent deformation, without relying on empirical parameters, including a transition from entropic to energetic elasticity.},

abstract = {The idea that enzymes accelerate their reactions by entropic effects has played a major role in many prominent proposals about the origin of enzyme catalysis. This idea implies that the binding to an enzyme active site freezes the motion of the reacting fragments and eliminates their entropic contributions, (delta S(cat)(double dagger))', to the activation energy. It is also implied that the binding entropy is equal to the activation entropy, (delta S(w)(double dagger))', of the corresponding solution reaction. It is, however, difficult to examine this idea by experimental approaches. The present paper defines the entropic proposal in a rigorous way and develops a computer simulation approach that determines (delta S(double dagger))'. This approach allows us to evaluate the differences between (delta S(double dagger))' of an enzymatic reaction and of the corresponding reference reaction in solution. Our approach is used in a study of the entropic contribution to the catalytic reaction of subtilisin. It is found that this contribution is much smaller than previously thought. This result is due to the following: (i) Many of the motions that are free in the reactants state of the reference solution reaction are also free at the transition state. (ii) The binding to the enzyme does not completely freeze the motion of the reacting fragments so that (delta S(double dagger))' in the enzymes is not zero. (iii) The binding entropy is not necessarily equal to (delta S(w)(double dagger))'.},

abstract = {Although the mechanical behavior of tendon and bone has been studied for decades, there is still relatively little understanding of the molecular basis for their specific properties. Thus, despite consisting structurally of the same type I collagen, bones and tendons have evolved to fulfill quite different functions in living organisms. In an attempt to understand the links between the mechanical properties of these collageneous structures at the macro- and nanoscale, we studied trimeric type I tropocollagen molecules by atomic force microscopy, both topologically and by force spectroscopy. High-resolution imaging demonstrated a mean (+/- SD) contour length of (287 +/- 35) nm and height of (0.21 +/- 0.03) nm. Submolecular features, namely the coil-pitch of the molecule, were also observed, appearing as a repeat pattern along the length of the molecule, with a length of approximately 8 nm that is comparable to the theoretical value. Using force spectroscopy, we established the stretching pattern of the molecule, where both the mechanical response of the molecule and pull-off peak are convoluted in a single feature. By interpreting this response with a wormlike chain model, we extracted the value of the effective contour length of the molecule at (202 +/- 5) nm. This value was smaller than that given by direct measurement, suggesting that the entire molecule was not being stretched during the force measurements; this is likely to be related to the absence of covalent binding between probe, sample, and substrate in our experimental procedure.},

@article{Bhattacharjee2005,
abstract = {This year marks the 50th anniversary of the coiled-coil triple helical structure of collagen, first proposed by Ramachandran's group from Madras. The structure is unique among the protein secondary structures in that it requires a very specific tripeptide sequence repeat, with glycine being mandatory at every third position and readily accommodates the imino acids proline/hydroxyproline, at the other two positions. The original structure was postulated to be stabilized by two interchain hydrogen bonds, per tripeptide. Subsequent modeling studies suggested that the triple helix is stabilized by one direct inter chain hydrogen bond as well as water mediated hydrogen bonds. The hydroxyproline residues were also implicated to play an important role in stabilizing the collagen fibres. Several high resolution crystal structures of oligopeptides related to collagen have been determined in the last ten years. Stability of synthetic mimics of collagen has also been extensively studied. These have confirmed the essential correctness of the coiled-coil triple helical structure of collagen, as well as the role of water and hydroxyproline residues, but also indicated additional sequence-dependent features. This review discusses some of these recent results and their implications for collagen fiber formation.},

A close comparison between theory and experiment in this area is promising to advance our understanding of the physical-chemical principles governing the folding process. The delicate interplay of entropic and energetic/enthalpic factors in the protein free energy regulates the details of this complex reaction. In this article, we propose the use of topological descriptors to quantify the amount of heterogeneity in the configurational entropy contribution to the free energy. We apply the procedure to a set of 16 two-state folding proteins. The results offer a clean and simple theoretical explanation for the experimentally measured folding rates and mechanisms, in terms of the intrinsic entropic roughness along the populated folding routes on the protein free energy landscape.},

Knowledge of the mechanical properties of single collagen molecules is essential in studying the self-assembly of collagen, the interaction between cells and extracellular matrix, the etiology of tissue degeneration and mechanism of regeneration, and the relationship between the structures and mechanical properties of tissues. Here we stretched single type II collagen molecules in neutral pH solution using optical tweezers. The molecular parameters of collagen were obtained by fitting force-extension curves into worm-like chain elasticity model. The molecule length of type II collagen monomer was 295.8 nm. The persistence length of type II collagen monomer was 11.2 nm. These observations indicate that collagen molecules are flexible rather than rigid rod molecules at neutral pH solution.},

abstract = {A comparison between two related methods, Schlitter's formula and quasiharmonic analysis, for calculating absolute entropies from the covariance matrix of atomic fluctuations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is presented. Calculations for a set of organic compounds in the gas phase are compared to the corresponding statistical thermodynamics results for translational and rotational entropies and to experimental data for vibrational entropies. Encouraging agreement is obtained for translational entropies, but for the rotational contribution, both methods fail to reproduce the theoretically calculated values. Absolute and relative vibrational entropies are found to be better reproduced using quasiharmonic analysis compared to Schlitter's formula. For rotational entropies, we propose a method based on the variances in Euler angles, which gives good agreement with theory. Alternative methods for estimating translational entropies based on principal root mean-square (rms) fluctuations of the center of mass are also presented, and these reproduce theoretically calculated values well. These methodologies are applied to the binding of benzene to T4-lysozyme, where close agreement with the literature is obtained for translational and rotational entropies.},

New evidence demonstrates that stereoelectronic effects and preorganization play a key role in that stability.

Artificial collagen fibrils that display some properties of natural collagen fibrils are now accessible using chemical synthesis and self-assembly.

abstract = {The DNA double helix undergoes an 'overstretching' transition in a narrow force range near 65 pN. Despite numerous studies the basic question of whether the strands are separated or not remains controversial. Here we show that overstretching in fact involves two distinct types of double-helix reorganization: slow hysteretic 'unpeeling' of one strand off the other; and a fast, non-hysteretic transition to an elongated double-stranded form. We demonstrate that the relative fraction of these two overstretched forms is sensitive to factors that affect DNA base pair stability, including DNA sequence, salt concentration and temperature. The balance between the two forms shifts near physiological solution conditions. This result, in addition to establishing the existence of an overstretched double-stranded state, also shows that double helix physical properties are tuned so that either unpeeling or overextension can be selected via small changes in molecule environment.},

abstract = {Advances in nanomanipulation techniques have made it possible to measure the response of an individual biomolecule to a force applied in the laboratory. Experiments that stretch a single molecule of duplex DNA have been difficult to interpret theoretically, particularly as the major changes in molecular structure caused by the force cannot be measured. In principle, computer simulation can calculate these conformational changes in atomic level detail, but to date such studies have failed to reproduce the experimental data due to the computational expense of the calculations. Here we show that a combination of molecular modeling and statistical physics can be used successfully to understand the stretching behavior of DNA. Our simulations provide new information about the dynamics of DNA denaturation under force in atomic level detail and also show the importance of entropy in determining biomechanical properties in general.},

For individual type 1 collagen fibrils from rat tail, the modulus was found to be in the range from 5 GPa to 11.5 GPa (in air and at room temperature). The hypothesis that collagen anisotropy is due to the subfibrils being aligned along the fibril axis is supported by nonuniform surface imprints performed by high load nanoindentation.},

In a novel approach, it was found, using atomic force microscopy, that tendon collagen fibrils are composed of subcomponents in a spiral disposition-that is, their structure is similar to that of macroscale ropes. Consequently, this arrangement was modeled and confirmed using elastic rod theory. This work provides new insight into collagen fibril structure and will have wide application-from the design of scaffolds for tissue engineering and a better understanding of pathogenesis of diseases of bone and tendon, to the conservation of irreplaceable parchment-based museum exhibits.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the elastic properties of DNA is required to understand the structural dynamics of cellular processes such as replication and transcription. Measurements of force and extension on single molecules of DNA have allowed direct determination of the molecule's mechanical properties, provided rigorous tests of theories of polymer elasticity, revealed unforeseen structural transitions induced by mechanical stresses, and established an experimental and conceptual framework for mechanical assays of enzymes that act on DNA. However, a complete description of DNA mechanics must also consider the effects of torque, a quantity that has hitherto not been directly measured in micromanipulation experiments. We have measured torque as a function of twist for stretched DNA--torsional strain in over- or underwound molecules was used to power the rotation of submicrometre beads serving as calibrated loads. Here we report tests of the linearity of DNA's twist elasticity, direct measurements of the torsional modulus (finding a value approximately 40\% higher than generally accepted), characterization of torque-induced structural transitions, and the establishment of a framework for future assays of torque and twist generation by DNA-dependent enzymes. We also show that cooperative structural transitions in DNA can be exploited to construct constant-torque wind-up motors and force-torque converters.},

abstract = {The aim of this report is to investigate at microscopic level the elastic properties of a tropocollagen-like molecule submitted to linear traction along its longitudinal axis. For this purpose, we performed steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations for a wide range of spring constants in order to test the molecular response based on a two-spring model connected in series. An elastic behavior was observed in an elongation range of 2.5-4\% of the molecular length, estimating an "effective molecular elastic constant" of 1.02+/-0.20 kcal/mol A2 in this region. Accordingly, a Young's modulus for the tropocollagen molecule of Y=4.8+/-1.0 GPa was calculated. The complex hydrogen bond network was traced along molecular dynamics (MD) and SMD simulations revealing a rearrangement of these interactions preserving the integrity of the molecular structure when submitted to traction. No evidence of the significant role attributed to water bridges for structural stability was detected, on the contrary facts pointed out that the hydrogen bond network might be the responsible.},

abstract = {Stiff polymers, such as single-stranded DNA, unstructured RNA and cellulose, are all basically extremely long rods with relatively short repeating monomers. The simplest model for describing such stiff polymers is called the freely jointed chain model, which treats a molecule as a chain of perfectly rigid subunits of orientationally independent statistical segments, joined together by perfectly flexible hinges. A more realistic model that incorporates the entropic elasticity of a molecule, called the worm-like chain model, has been proposed by assuming that each monomer resists the bending force. Some force-extension formulae for the worm-like chain model have been previously found in terms of interpolation and numerical solutions resulting from statistical mechanics. In this paper, however, we adopt a variational principle to seek the minimum energy configuration of a stretched molecule by incorporating all the possible orientations of each monomer under thermal equilibrium, i.e., constant temperature. We determine a force-extension formula for the worm-like chain model analytically. We find that our formula suggests new terms such as the free energy and the cut-off force of a molecule, which define a clear transition from the entropic regime to the enthalpic regime and the fracture of the molecule, respectively. In addition, we predict two possible phase changes for a stretched molecule, i.e., from a super-helix to a soliton and then from a soliton to a vertical twisted line. We show theoretically that a molecule must undergo at least one phase change before it is fully stretched into its total contour length. This new formula is used to fit recent experimental data and shows a good agreement with some current literature that uses a statistical approach. Finally, an instability analysis is adopted to investigate the sensitivity of the new formula subject to small changes in temperature.},

To probe the cross-links on the lower level of organization, we used a cantilever to pull substructures out of the assembly. Advanced force probe technology, using small cantilevers (length <20 microm), improved the force resolution into the sub-10 pN range. In the force versus extension curves, we found an exponential increase in force and two different periodic rupture events, one with strong bonds (jumps in force of several hundred pN) with a periodicity of 78 nm and one with weak bonds (jumps in force of <7 pN) with a periodicity of 22 nm. We demonstrate a good correlation between the measured mechanical behavior of collagen fibers and their appearance in the micrographs taken with the atomic force microscope.},

abstract = {Internal motion is central to protein folding, to protein stability through the resulting residual entropy, and to protein function. Despite its importance, the precise nature of the internal motions of protein macromolecules remains a mystery. Here we report a survey of the temperature dependence of the fast dynamics of methyl-bearing side chains in a calmodulin-peptide complex using site-specific deuterium NMR relaxation methods. The amplitudes of motion had a markedly heterogeneous spectrum and segregated into three largely distinct classes. Other proteins studied at single temperatures tend to segregate similarly. Furthermore, a large variability in the degree of thermal activation of the dynamics in the calmodulin complex indicates a heterogeneous distribution of residual entropy and hence reveals the microscopic origins of heat capacity in proteins. These observations also point to an unexpected explanation for the low-temperature 'glass transition' of proteins. It is this transition that has been ascribed to the creation of protein motional modes that are responsible for biological activity.},

abstract = {Single-molecule manipulation studies have revealed that double-stranded DNA undergoes a structural transition when subjected to tension. At forces that depend on the attachment geometry of the DNA (65 pN or 110 pN), it elongates approximately 1.7-fold and its elastic properties change dramatically. The nature of this overstretched DNA has been under debate. In one model, the DNA cooperatively unwinds, while base pairing remains intact. In a competing model, the hydrogen bonds between base pairs break and two single DNA strands are formed, comparable to thermal DNA melting. Here, we resolve the structural basis of DNA overstretching using a combination of fluorescence microscopy, optical tweezers, and microfluidics. In DNA molecules undergoing the transition, we visualize double- and single-stranded segments using specific fluorescent labels. Our data directly demonstrate that overstretching comprises a gradual conversion from double-stranded to single-stranded DNA, irrespective of the attachment geometry. We found that these conversions favorably initiate from nicks or free DNA ends. These discontinuities in the phosphodiester backbone serve as energetically favorable nucleation points for melting. When both DNA strands are intact and no nicks or free ends are present, the overstretching force increases from 65 to 110 pN and melting initiates throughout the molecule, comparable to thermal melting. These results provide unique insights in the thermodynamics of DNA and DNA-protein interactions.},

@article{Marrink2007,
abstract = {We present an improved and extended version of our coarse grained lipid model. The new version, coined the MARTINI force field, is parametrized in a systematic way, based on the reproduction of partitioning free energies between polar and apolar phases of a large number of chemical compounds. To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols. Application to a bilayer/cholesterol system at various concentrations shows the typical cholesterol condensation effect similar to that observed in all atom representations.},

@article{Ottani2001,
abstract = {The bio-mechanical requirements to which the connective tissue is subjected suggest that a causal correlation exist between the substructure and the collagen fibril function. We discuss the relationship between the inner structure of collagen fibrils, their diameter, their spatial layout and the functional requirements they have to withstand, and suggest that collagen fibrils may belong to two different forms indicated as "T-type" and "C-type". The first class, consisting of large, heterogeneous fibrils, parallely tightly packed, subjected to tensile stress along their axis is found in highly tensile structures such as tendons, ligaments and bone. The other class, consisting of small, homogeneous fibrils, helically arranged, resisting multidirectional stresses, is mostly present within highly compliant tissues such as blood vessel walls, skin and nerve sheaths. What causes these architectures to appear is discussed in detail in this review.},

@article{Peyrard2009,
abstract = {Understanding the melting of short DNA sequences probes DNA at the scale of the genetic code and raises questions which are very different from those posed by very long sequences, which have been extensively studied. We investigate this problem by combining experiments and theory. A new experimental method allows us to make a mapping of the opening of the guanines along the sequence as a function of temperature. The results indicate that non-local effects may be important in DNA because an AT-rich region is able to influence the opening of a base pair which is about 10 base pairs away. An earlier mesoscopic model of DNA is modified to correctly describe the timescales associated with the opening of individual base pairs well below melting, and to properly take into account the sequence. Using this model to analyze some characteristic sequences for which detailed experimental data on the melting is available (Montrichok et al 2003 Europhys. Lett. 62 452), we show that we have to introduce non-local effects of AT-rich regions to get acceptable results. This brings a second indication that the influence of these highly fluctuating regions of DNA on their neighborhood can extend to some distance.},

@article{Stone2001,
abstract = {Recent advances in the measurement and analysis of protein NMR relaxation data have made it possible to characterize the dynamical properties of many backbone and side chain groups. With certain caveats, changes in flexibility that occur upon ligand binding, mutation, or changes in sample conditions can be interpreted in terms of contributions to conformational entropy. Backbone and side chain flexibility can either decrease or increase upon ligand binding. Decreases are often associated with "enthalpy-entropy compensation" and "induced fit" binding, whereas increases in conformational entropy can contribute to stabilization of complexes. In certain cases, conformational entropy appears to play a role in cooperative binding and enzyme catalysis. In addition, variations in conformational entropy and heat capacity may both be important in stabilizing the folded structures of proteins.},
